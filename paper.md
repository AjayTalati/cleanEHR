# Summary
cleanEHR works with the Critical Care Health Informatics Collaborative dataset. 
Since 2014 data from the critical care units at
Cambridge, Guys/Kings/St Thomas', Imperial, Oxford, and University College
London has been extracted and stored securely in a standardised format.

The purpose of cleanEHR is to enable researchers to answer clinical questions
that are important to patients, but which are normally too difficult because
data is messy and inaccessible. cleanEHR is created to address various data
reliability and accessibility problems. It provides a platform that enables data
manipulation, transformation, reduction, anonymisation, cleaning and validation.
It also offers a friendly interface which empowers non-programmers to conduct
basic data analysis by simply writing a human-readable configuration file.
